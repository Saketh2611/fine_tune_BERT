[Passcode & Biometrics] You can enable FaceID or Fingerprint login in the 'Security' section of the app. If you forget your passcode, use the 'Forgot Passcode' link on the login screen to reset it via email.

[Virtual Cards] You can generate a Virtual Card immediately for online shopping. These are free and separate from your physical card.
[Disposable Cards] For extra security, use a Disposable Virtual Card. The number changes after every single transaction, making it impossible for hackers to reuse.
[Activation] When your physical card arrives, use the app to scan the card or enter the last 4 digits to activate it.
[Pins] You can view or unblock your PIN instantly in the app under 'Card Settings'.
[Contactless] Contactless payments work for amounts up to $50. For security, you must perform one Chip & PIN transaction first to enable contactless.

[Speed] Domestic transfers (Same-country) are usually instant but can take up to 2 hours. International (SWIFT) transfers take 3-5 business days.
[Beneficiaries] If you cannot add a beneficiary, check if their bank is in a sanctioned country or if the IBAN format is correct.
[Cancelling] Once a transfer is "Executed", it cannot be cancelled. If it is "Pending", you may have a 'Cancel' button in the transaction details.
[Failed Transfers] If a transfer fails, the money is usually reverted to your account within 24 hours. Common reasons include incorrect account numbers or insufficient funds.
[Limits] Standard accounts can transfer up to $5,000 per day. Premium accounts can transfer up to $20,000 per day.

[Limits] New users have a daily top-up limit of $1,000 to prevent fraud. This increases automatically after 30 days of activity.
[Failed Top-up] If your top-up fails, check with your other bank to ensure they aren't blocking the transaction as "Suspicious Activity".


[Exchange Rates] We use the real-time interbank exchange rate (the same one you see on Google).
[Weekend Fee] The currency markets close on weekends. To protect against fluctuations, we charge a 1% markup on foreign exchanges made on Saturdays and Sundays.
